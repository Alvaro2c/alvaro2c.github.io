Hi, I'm Alvaro Carranza, an economic analyst / former social scientist turned Data scientist / Analyst. The first sentence has been on my mind since I was in college and hasn't left since.
The second and third are among the things that resonated the most during the 24 weeks I spent in <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">Le Wagon</a>'s Data Science & AI Bootcamp from April to October 2023.

In the last 13 years of my life I have had the opportunity to learn and apply my learning to real problems in diverse settings, from academia to economic diplomacy (you can read more about it [here](/cv)). More recently, and inevitably, data has been at the core of an increasing amount of subjects I have dealt with as an analyst, but of course also a fundamental part of the solutions.

Equipped with a new set of data skills, the main goal of this blog is to document and share my journey in this exciting career path, now solving problems as a Data Scientist / Analyst. I am eager to continue learning, turning data into insight, developing ML models and building data systems. I will write about the ins and outs of <a href="https://hs-detector.streamlit.app" target="_blank">HS Detector Web App</a>, a Deep Learning tool developed for early detection of Hereditary Spherocytosis, the progress of my current project building a Spanish Public Procurement Database (SPPD), and all things data. <br />

But I will start simple.
